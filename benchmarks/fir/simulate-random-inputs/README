Claim: For insert sort, the "reversed card deck" is the input that 
intuitively leads to WCET. However, not all reversed decks have the same
executin time. Only one specific reversed card deck will lead to ET=WCET.

This is what we test here...

Reasoning:
---------
The compiler may create additional BBs at object level, which are not
existent at source level. Even worse, it may create cycles (loops) whose
actual bounds depend on the numeric values.

The WCET must consider the worst-case for those low-level loops, otherwise
it is not sound.

Assume there exists an input that leads to the WCET. Then, finding this can 
only be done at machine level, otherwise the variation is not captured.

However, on source-level, the WCET input takes a certain path. There exist
other input sets, which take tahe the same path, but have different low-level
timing. Since low-level code is not visible at source level (and cannot be
influenced by the developer), it is not of interest. Any input which takes the
same paths in the source code is therefore of the same interest.
