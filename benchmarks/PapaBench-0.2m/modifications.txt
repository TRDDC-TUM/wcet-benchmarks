The following modifications were made to make papabench v0.2 compile with recent
avr-gcc deb4.8.1/Atmega3.4.4 utils:

 1. added -mmcu flags for both fbw and autopilot (fixes linker errors)
 2. updated code with new ISR names (was poisoned signals before). Followed substitutions given here: 
    http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__interrupts.html
 3. Changed optimization flag from -O2 to -Os, because fbw does not fit into text segment otherwise
 
Further changes to enable WCET analysis:
 - fbw: isolated body of infinite loop into a separate function "periodic_task" and avoided inlining
